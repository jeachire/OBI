\usage{
imputeRightCensor(x, delta, theta, dist = "weibull")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of observed or censored survival times.}

\item{delta}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x},
indicating the censoring status of each observation:
\code{1} for observed values and \code{0} for right-censored values.}

\item{theta}{A numeric vector of distribution parameters.
The length and interpretation depend on \code{dist}:
\itemize{
\item \code{"weibull"}: \code{c(shape, scale)}
\item \code{"exponential"}: \code{c(rate)}
}}

\item{dist}{A character string specifying the distribution.
Supported options are \code{"weibull"} and \code{"exponential"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}, where censored
observations (\code{delta = 0}) are replaced by random imputations
drawn from the conditional distribution, and observed values remain unchanged.
}
\description{
Imputes right-censored observations from a specified
parametric distribution, using random draws from the conditional
survival distribution.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item For censored observations, the imputation is drawn from the
conditional distribution of the survival time given that it
exceeds the censoring time.
\item For uncensored observations, the original values are preserved.
}

The imputation is performed using the inversion method with random uniforms.

delta <- c(1, 0, 1, 0)  # two censored observations
