Description: Tools for performing objective Bayesian inference in reliability 
    and survival analysis. The package implements Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
    algorithms for censored data, objective prior distributions (such as Jeffreys' prior), 
    and functions for parameter estimation and model fitting. 
    It is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in objective Bayesian 
    methods for lifetime distributions.
